# Predicting correct exercise technique with Sensors

An exploration and analysis of machine learning techniques on a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The project analyses weight lifting technique using sensors attached to the body and exercise equipment.

The data set used can be found at - [Groupware@LES](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#weight_lifting_exercises). The related [paper](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/public/papers/2013.Velloso.QAR-WLE.pdf) describes the techniques the group used to predicate correct technique and other related issues.

This project is an assignment as part of the Coursera [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn) course. The Goal is to use the data above to explore machine learning techniques and create a
